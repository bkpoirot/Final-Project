	OBJECTIVE: map line 1 to 1-1, and line 2 to 2-1.
	sample:
	
**********************************************************************************
	You're in a cold, dark room. all you see are two doors in front of you,
one on the left, and one on the right.

Select a choice from below:
1) You go down the left door
2) you go down the right door
your choice -> 1 
You open the left door, and begin to walk down. However, you are shot and die.
***********************************************************************************

^^for above, if we can get parsing  and interpreting user input to work,
	that would be preferred. However, the current priority is to map strings to one another.

NOTE: potential need for flavor text, decision text, and outcome text to be delimited into
appropriate categories and linked.
